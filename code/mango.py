''' code was originally written to help a friend with a side quest
    the algorithm in the file i was sent:
        "for example the (7,2) system: 
        make a sequence 7,9,11,13,15 and code the first letter of your message with +7 
        if you are at the end of the alphabet, you count further from the beginning, 
        the second with +9, etc. with +7 we mean: shift 7 letters to the right. 
        spaces are removed."
    no idea if this is an alrdy existing & popular cipher or what but credits to whoever
    wrote this.
