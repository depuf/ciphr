# ciphr

# Overview

This program is designed to handle both Vigenère and Caesar ciphers, with the ability to encrypt and decrypt texts.

# Current features (28 September)
- supports encryption and decryption for caesar cipher, and brute forces caesar when shift is unknown
- supports encryption and decryption(with known key) for vigenère cipher. decryption without key works for almost any cipher text with repeating sequences, decryption for texts without any repeats (and a better read me) coming soon
